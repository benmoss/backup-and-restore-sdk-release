bbr integration tests

1. Create a release
    1. Will have the bbr backup and restore scripts
    1. Will have the bbr-sdk-release colocated
    1. The backup and restore scripts call the bbr-sdk script.
1. Deploy a release (maybe using the pipeline, to simplify our end -- make it hard to test locally)
1. Call bbr backup
1. Assert that the backup works
1. Modify the db somehow (dropping a table or DB)
1. Call bbr restore
1. Assert that the restore worked
1. Wrap all that in a pipeline/script
